 <p><font size="5">Detail:</p>
<p><h><font size="4">It was
	 after successfully building up a business and selling it in 1990 that I sought out, through education 
	 and research, the best ways to influence workers and other negotiating partners.
	This is the knowledge and skill I share with you. </p><p>Many years of managing people and businesses 
	gives me an empathy with why diversity can be viewed as something that slows 
	down the primary focus of a business rather than being the valuable opportunity that it is.</p><p>I bring you a wide range of experience 
	and education together
	with a low key, strong, persistent personality to help you direct the energy of your group towards
	success. </p></h>

	Work experience.
</b>
<ul type="full circle">
	<li>Since June 2001 I have worked as a negotiator and facilitator with workplace,
	 property, custody, tenancy and neighbourhood issues.  My negotiation and mediation training 
	improves the effectiveness of my human resources work by widening the range of 
	approaches I use to deal with diverse attitudes and ideas.<p>In Oct 2003 I assisted with mediation
	coaching for LEADR (Leading Edge Alternative Disputes Resolution). In feedback from five participating 
	lawyers, four rated my coaching as very good and 
	one excellent.</p><p>
	At the LEADR workshop in June 2001 I 
	demonstrated <br>
	<p>
		“good performance – especially on one to one work in private sessions.  
	Some lovely question/role reversals. Good interventions. Dealt with feeling issues 
	well.”  (Assessment report available.)</li>
	<p>
	<li>From 1999 to 2001 as a human resources consultant, I was contracted to plan, develop and carry 
	out a performance evaluation system for staff at a national college that contained a large Maori 
	component.  This included motivating 
	people to change and overcome issues.  <br>
<p>	"Mary has implemented this evaluation process with a remarkable degree of success which has been 
invaluable for both the 
College and the tutors. She was able to quickly grasp and effectively understand the College 'culture'. 
   ...  I have found Mary to be a person with a low-key, non-confrontational manner. This has been a
    most important 
   quality in enabling her to deal effectively with sensitive issues when working with staff. She has
    worked in a way that has
   engendered the respect and trust of the staff. Mary also has the ability to listen and reflect and
    at the same time, is able to see the situation quite objectively. She is a very clear thinker and can 
   effectively summarise complex situations. I have found that at all times Mary demonstrates very 
   high professional standards and I would highly recommend her.”  
	(Full reference available).  
	<p>This led to further studies to increase my skills.</li>
	<li>My work advising on employment law increases my appreciation and experience of managing 
	the many diverse conflict situations that confront people. Working alongside many local top employment 
	solicitors enables me to keep up with current practical interpretations of the labour law.</li>
	<li>Many years of managing people and businesses incuding being a restaurateur, sales manager for 
	a large market garden, catering business owner, property developer and general nurse
	gives me empathy with both employers and employees. </li>
</ul>
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="OrangeBar.gif" width="495" height="7">
<br>
<p>
	I have had an in-depth insight into the different perspectives of people from
	diverse situations for example: <br>
	Information technology, computer programming, graphic
	art, microbiology, organic and conventional farming, civil and structural
	engineering, accounting, building/carpentry, service maintenance, factory work,
	Maori, European and Chinese cultures and physical and mental handicaps.

	Relevant Education</b>
<ul type="full circle">
   <li>In June 2004 I attended the Harvard Law School's Summer School on advanced negotiation.
    Harvard's Negotiation Project has been recognised as the world leader for 
    negotiation and mediation since it was developed to deal with concerns over U.S.-Soviet relations 
    in the 1980's. I fine-tuned my negotiating skills during the two weeks of intense workshops.</li>
   <li>Advanced mediation training through Bond University and LEADR in 2002 and 2003 
   enables me to adapt the basic 
   negotiation processes to suit individual circumstances and uses.</li>
	<li>LEADR mediation training gives me proven processes to follow, enabling me to put 
	all of life’s experiences into being most a effective relationship specialist.</li>
	<li>A Certificate of Proficiency in labour law, with its emphasis on 
	the different historical and political forces, provides an overview of the social and legal
	environment and the issues effecting people without the dividing influence that general 
	litigation exerts.
	</li>
	<li>A Human Resources Diploma covering six business management papers gives me an understanding 
	and appreciation of the dynamics and emotions of diversity especially in the workplace decision-making
	 process.</li>
	<li>My continuous ongoing education gives me a wide perspective to draw empathy, 
	understanding and negotiation options from.</li>
	<li>Training as a general nurse equips me well to deal with people under stress.</li>
</ul>
      
<p>
Thus my education, work and life experience has given me a wealth of skills to effectively 
convert the energy of diverse perspectives into the success of a common goal.
