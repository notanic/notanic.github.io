	PON Stands for Program on Negotiation</font>

<p>
    <font size="4">
	The Program on Negotiation began in the 1980s to study how U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved 
	and has become the foremost international authority on negotiation.

	I attended two weeks of intense workshops on negotiation and advanced negotiation at Harvard 
	Law School in June 2004. Each day we each negotiated complex cases on a diverse variety
	of issues using different techniques. These were then reviewed.

    <font size="4">
	The first week was lead by Bruce patton with Roger Fisher. Roger Fisher, William Ury and Bruce 
	Patton wrote Getting to Yes - Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In. That book
	  provides the 
	cornerstone to negotiation worldwide. Bruce and Roger consult widely with governments, corporations 
	and individuals. </font>
</p>
<p><font size="4">The second week of advanced negotiation workshops was lead by Bruce Patton, Sheila Heen and Douglas 
Stone. They wrote the book Difficult Conversations on which the week's workshops were based. We learnt 
to understand and manage dilemmas that may arise in negotiations such as when emotions run high and relationships
become strained. Sheila and Douglas also consult widely and internationally on
different aspects of negotiation.
