<ul type="full circle">
	<li><font size="4">Following the initial free interview we give clients an outline of the processes 
	that will meet their requirements and a probable time-frame. Following that, the cost of workplace
	 negotiation starts at $155 NZ dollars per
	 hour plus GST. This increases with the complexity of the case and size of the 
	 issues involved.</font><p></p></li>
	 
	 <li><font size="4">Family and neighbourhood issues costs depend on the circumstances of the 
	 clients. Referrals from the Community Law Center have the first three hours free.   
	</font><p></p></li>

	<li><font size="4">For negotiation/mediation within Christchurch clients can use my office at 
	no cost.  
	Outside of Christchurch any hire of neutral premises, toll or travel and accommodation expenses 
	incurred by me for the performance of their consultations will be arranged and paid for by the 
	parties in addition to the fee.</font><p></p></li>
<li>
    <font size="4">
	In the case of mediation there is no cost unless all of the clients involved agree to
	 participate. Information about processes 
	and discussions to help you decide if you wish to proceed are free.</font><p></p>
</li>
	<li><font size="4">A two person mediation is usually completed within four hours.</font><p></p></li>
